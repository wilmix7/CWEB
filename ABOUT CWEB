ABOUT WINDOWS  PLATFORM and  MOBILES
=====================================

WINDOWS  OS  is   mostly  affected  by  malware   , hackers,virus   so
Windows  Plaform  is   not considered   for   CWEB  section.
  
  Recently    mobiles  are   affectly  by virus,hackers,etc. 
  
  There is no security  in mobiles.
  
  so mobile is   not  considered  for remote webapplication.
  
  CWEB  doesnot  follows  DOTNET  and  VC++  style.
  
  but CWEB follows  JAVA7.0  and  C/C++ style.
